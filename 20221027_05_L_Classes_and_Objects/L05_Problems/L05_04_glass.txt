Create a class called Glass.
Upon initialization, it will not receive any parameters.

You must create an instance attribute called content which should be equal to 0.
You should also create a class attribute called capacity which should be 250 ml.

Create 3 instance methods:
    *) fill(ml) - fills the glass with the given milliliters if there is enough space in it and returns "Glass filled with {ml} ml",
                  otherwise returns "Cannot add {ml} ml"

    *) empty() - empties the glass and returns "Glass is now empty"

    *) info() - returns info about the glass in the format "{space_left} ml left"
