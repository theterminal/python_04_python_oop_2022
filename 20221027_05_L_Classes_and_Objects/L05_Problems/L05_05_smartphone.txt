Create a class called Smartphone.
Upon initialization, it should receive a memory (number).
It should also have 2 other instance attributes: apps (empty list by default) and is_on (False by default).

Create 3 methods:
    *) power() - sets is_on on True if the phone is off, otherwise sets it to False

    *) install(app, app_memory)
        - If there is enough memory on the phone and it is on,
          installs the app (add it to apps and decrease the memory of the phone) and returns "Installing {app}"

        - If there is enough memory, but the phone is off, returns "Turn on your phone to install {app}"

        - Otherwise, returns "Not enough memory to install {app}"

    *) status() - returns "Total apps: {total_apps_count}. Memory left: {memory_left}"

Test Code 1:
-----------
smartphone = Smartphone(100)
print(smartphone.install("Facebook", 60))
smartphone.power()
print(smartphone.install("Facebook", 60))
