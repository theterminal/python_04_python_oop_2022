In a folder called project create three files: animal.py, dog.py, and cat.py.

In each file, create its corresponding class - Animal, Dog, and Cat:

    *) Animal with a single method eat() that returns: "eating..."
    *) Dog with a single method bark() that returns: "barking..."
    *) Cat with a single method meow() that returns: "meowing..."

Both Dog and Cat should inherit from Animal.
