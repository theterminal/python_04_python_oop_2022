In a folder called project create three files: vehicle.py and car.py, and sports_car.py.
In each file, create its corresponding class - Vehicle, Car, and SportsCar:

    *) Vehicle with a single method move() that returns: "moving..."
    *) Car with a single method drive() that returns: "driving..."
    *) SportsCar with a single method race() that returns: "racing...".

SportsCar should inherit from Car and Car should inherit from Vehicle.
