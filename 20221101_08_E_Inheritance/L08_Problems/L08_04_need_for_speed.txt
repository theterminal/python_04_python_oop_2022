Create the following hierarchy with the following classes:


                                      class Vehicle
                                      -------------

               class Motorcycle                                        class Car
class RaceMotorcycle     class CrossMotorcycle            class FamilyCar     class SportCar


Submit in judge a zip file containing a separate file for each of the classes using the structure shown below:


project
    __init__.py
    car.py
    cross_motorcycle.py
    family_car.py
    motorcycle.py
    race_motorcycle.py
    sport_car.py
    vehicle.py


Create a base class Vehicle.
It should contain the following attributes:
    *) DEFAULT_FUEL_CONSUMPTION: float (constant)
    *) fuel_consumption: float - represents the fuel consumption per kilometer
    *) fuel: float - represents the quantity of fuel in a specific vehicle
    *) horse_power: int

Upon initialization, the class should receive fuel and horse_power.
The DEFAULT_FUEL_CONSUMPTION value should be set to the fuel_consumption value.
Each class should have the following methods:
    *) drive(kilometers) - reduces the fuel based on the traveled kilometers and fuel consumption (km * fuel consumption).
       Keep in mind that you can start driving the vehicle only if you have enough fuel to finish the driving.

The default fuel consumption for the different vehicles is:
    *) Vehicle is 1.25
    *) SportCar is 10
    *) RaceMotorcycle is 8
    *) Car is 3


_____________ Test Data ______________


Test Code 1:
-----------
vehicle = Vehicle(50, 150)
print(Vehicle.DEFAULT_FUEL_CONSUMPTION)
print(FamilyCar.DEFAULT_FUEL_CONSUMPTION)
print(vehicle.fuel)
print(vehicle.horse_power)
print(vehicle.fuel_consumption)
vehicle.drive(100)
print(vehicle.fuel)
family_car = FamilyCar(150, 150)
family_car.drive(50)
print(family_car.fuel)
family_car.drive(50)
print(family_car.fuel)
print(family_car.__class__.__bases__[0].__name__)


Output 1:
--------
1.25
3
50
