20221101 - Python OOP - Inheritance
02 - Zoo - judge link: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Compete/Index/1941#1


Create a zoo project that contains the following classes:

                              class Animal
          class Reptile                         class Mammal
  class Lizard    class Snake           class Gorilla    class Bear


Submit in judge a zip file of the project, containing a separate file for each of the classes using the structure shown below:

project
    __init__.py
    animal.py
    bear.py
    gorilla.py
    lizard.py
    mammal.py
    reptile.py
    snake.py


Follow the diagram and create all the classes.
Except for the Animal class, each class should inherit from another class, as shown in the diagram.
The Animal class should receive a name - string upon initialization.
Every class should have a constructor, which accepts one parameter: name


_____________ Test Data ______________


Test Code 1:
-----------
mammal = Mammal("Stella")
print(mammal.__class__.__bases__[0].__name__)
print(mammal.name)
lizard = Lizard("John")
print(lizard.__class__.__bases__[0].__name__)
print(lizard.name)


Output 1:
--------
Animal
Stella
Reptile
