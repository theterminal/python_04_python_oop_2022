You are asked to model an application for storing data about people.
You should be able to have a Person and a Child.
Every person receives name and age upon initialization.
Your task is to model the application.
Create a Child class that inherits Person and has the same constructor definition.
However, do not copy the code from the Person class - reuse the Person class's constructor.

Submit in judge a zip file named project, containing a separate file (person.py and child.py) for each of the classes.
