Python OOP Exam - Food Orders App

Problem 1 and Problem 2


Submit your solutions in the SoftUni judge system at https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/3591#0
You are given a task to create a basic class application.
You will be provided with a skeleton that includes all the folders and files you will need.

Note: You are not allowed to change the folder and file structure and change their names!


-------------------------------------


project
    meals
        __init__.py
        dessert.py
        main_dish.py
        meal.py
        starter.py
    __init__.py
    client.py
    food_orders_app.py


-------------------------------------


Judge Upload
------------
For the first 2 problems, create a zip file with the project folder and upload it to the judge system.
For the last problem, create a zip file with the test folder and upload it to the judge system.
You do not need to include in the zip file your venv, .idea, pycache, and __MACOSX (for Mac users),
so you do not exceed the maximum allowed size of 16.00 KB.

Structure (Problem 1) and Functionality (Problem 2)
Our first task is to implement the structure and functionality of the classes (properties, methods, inheritance, etc.)

You are free to add additional attributes (instance attributes, class attributes, methods, dunder methods, etc.)
to simplify your code and increase readability as long as it does not change the project's result according to the
requirements and the program works properly.


1 - Class Client
----------------
In the client.py file, the class Client should be implemented.

    *) Structure
       The class should have the following attributes:

        - phone_number: str
            >>> A string that represents the phone number of the client

            >>> It must start with "0" (zero), must be 10 characters long, and must contain only numbers.
                Otherwise, raise a ValueError with the message:
                "Invalid phone number!"

        - shopping_cart: list
            >>> An empty list that will contain all meals (objects) added by the client

        - bill: float

6 - Class FoodOrdersApp
-----------------------
In the food_orders_app.py file, the class FoodOrdersApp should be implemented.
It will contain all the functionality of the project.

    *) Structure
       The class should have the following attributes:

        - menu: list
          An empty list that will contain all the meals (objects)

        - clients_list: list
          An empty list that will contain all the clients (objects)

    *) Methods

        - __init__()

        In the __init__ method all the needed attributes must be set.

        - register_client(client_phone_number: str)

            >>> Creates a client (object) and adds it to the client list and returns the message
                "Client {phone_number} registered successfully."

            >>> If a client with the same phone number is already registered, raise an Exception with the message
                "The client has already been registered!"

        - add_meals_to_menu(*meals: Meal)

            >>> This method adds all the meals (objects) given to the menu list.

            >>> If one or more of the provided objects are NOT meals (not a "Starter", a "MainDish", or a "Dessert")
                ignore them and keep adding only the meals.

            >>> Note: you will always be given meals with different names.

        - show_menu()

            >>> It should return the details() for each meal on the menu on separate lines

            >>> If there are less than 5 meals on the menu, raise an Exception with the message
                "The menu is not ready!"

        - add_meals_to_shopping_cart(client_phone_number: str, **meal_names_and_quantities)

          The client attempts to order food. All clients can add any meal that is on the menu if there is enough
          quantity. You will be given a dictionary with the meal names as keys and the quantity the client wants for
          each meal as values.

            >>> Adds the meals (objects) to the client's shopping cart. It also increases the client's bill with
                the price for the concrete meal by the quantity added and decreases the meal quantity on the menu.
                Returns the message:
                "Client {client_phone_number} successfully ordered {meal_names} for {client_bill}lv."

                a) The meal names refer to all meal names on the client's shopping cart. They should be separated by a
                   comma and a space ", ".

                b) The bill is the total amount of money for all meals on the client's shopping cart.
                   It should be formatted to the second decimal point.

            >>> First, the client can only add meals to his/her cart when the menu is ready.
                If there are less than 5 meals on the menu, raise an Exception with the message:
                "The menu is not ready!"

            >>> If the client with the provided phone number is not registered in the app, he/she should be registered
                automatically with the provided phone number, then he/she can continue with the order.

            >>> If a meal with the given name is not on the menu, raise an Exception with the message:
                "{meal_name} is not on the menu!"

                a) If the exception is raised, the client could NOT make the order at all
                   (none of the meals should be added to the client's shopping cart, and the bill should not be increased).

            >>> If there isn't enough quantity of a meal to be added to the cart, you must raise an Exception with the
                following message:
                "Not enough quantity of {meal_type}: {meal_name}!"

                a) The meal types are "Starter", "MainDish" and "Dessert"

                b) If the exception is raised, the client could NOT make the order at all
                   (none of the meals should be added to the client's shopping cart, and the bill should not be increased).

        - cancel_order(client_phone_number: str)

          You will always be given an existing client phone number.

            >>> The client decides to cancel his/ her order. This method removes all the meals that the client has added
                to his/her shopping cart and resets the bill to 0 and returns the message:
                "Client {phone_number} successfully canceled his order.".
                Keep in mind that you should update the quantity of the meals on the menu list after the cancellation.

            >>> If there are no meals on the client's shopping cart, raise an Exception with the message
                "There are no ordered meals!"

        - finish_order(client_phone_number: str)

          You will always be given an existing client phone number.

            >>> The client pays the bill and receives the ordered meals. This method removes all the meals that the
                client has added to his/her cart and resets the bill to 0. Then, it returns the following message:
                "Receipt #{receipt_id} with total amount of {total_paid_money} was successfully paid for {client_phone_number}."

                a) The receipt_id is automatically generated each time a bill is paid (regardless of the client).
                   It starts from 1 and increases by 1 with each new paid bill.

                b) The total paid money should be formatted to the second decimal place.

            >>> If there are no meals on the client's shopping cart, raise an Exception with the message:
                "There are no ordered meals!"

        - __str__()

          This method should return a string with the following information:
          "Food Orders App has {number_of_listed_meals} meals on the menu and {number_of_clients} clients."

            >>>Note: The number of listed meals is the number of added-to-the-menu meals (objects), NOT their total quantity.
