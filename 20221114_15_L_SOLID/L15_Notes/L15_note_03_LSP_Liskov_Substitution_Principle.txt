# 20221114 - Python - Python OOP - SOLID
Note 03 - LCP (Liskov Substitution Principle)


Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types.
Derived classes
    *) only extend functionalities of the base class
    *) must not remove base class behavior

LSP is fundamental to a good object-oriented software design because it emphasizes one of its core traits â€“ polymorphism.
It is about creating correct hierarchies so that classes derived from a base one are polymorphic along the parent one.
Carefully thinking about new classes in the way that LSP suggests helps us to extend the hierarchy correctly.
We could say that LSP contributes to the OCP.
