04 - Entertainment System - (ISP - Interface Segregation Principle)


We have been hired to create a game where the player sets up entertainment systems.
Each piece of the system (television, game console, etc.) uses a specific cable to connect to another device.
The TV uses an HDMI cable to connect to a game console.
Both the game console and TV connect to a router via an ethernet cable to access the internet.
And lastly, all the devices are connected to the wall via a power cable so they can turn on.
Your job is to extend this behavior in the device classes.
