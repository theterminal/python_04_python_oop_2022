In this exercise, everyone should use the given source code (skeleton).


Skeleton should look like this:
------------------------------


project
    __init__.py
    problem.py
test
    __init__.py
    test_problem.py


------------------------------


class Student:
    def __init__(self, name: str, courses=None):
        if courses is None:
            courses = {}
        self.name = name
        self.courses = courses  # {course_name: [notes]}

    def enroll(self, course_name: str, notes, add_course_notes: str = ""):
        if course_name in self.courses.keys():
            [self.courses[course_name].append(x) for x in notes]
            return "Course already added. Notes have been updated."

        if add_course_notes == "Y" or add_course_notes == "":
            self.courses[course_name] = notes
            return "Course and course notes have been added."

        self.courses[course_name] = []
        return "Course has been added."

    def add_notes(self, course_name, notes):
        if course_name in self.courses.keys():
            self.courses[course_name].append(notes)
            return "Notes have been updated"
        raise Exception("Cannot add notes. Course not found.")

    def leave_course(self, course_name):
        if course_name in self.courses.keys():
            self.courses.pop(course_name)
            return "Course has been removed"
        raise Exception("Cannot remove course. Course not found.")

*) You have the structure and functionality of the classe, and now you should test it.
*) You are NOT ALLOWED to change the class.
*) Cover the whole class with unit tests to make sure that the class is working as intended.

Submit only the test folder.
