In this exercise, everyone should use the given source code (skeleton).


Skeleton should look like this:
------------------------------


project
    __init__.py
    problem.py
test
    __init__.py
    test_problem.py


--------------------------------------


class Hero:
    username: str
    health: float
    damage: float
    level: int

    def __init__(self, username: str, level: int, health: float, damage: float):
        self.username = username
        self.level = level
        self.health = health
        self.damage = damage

    def battle(self, enemy_hero):
        if enemy_hero.username == self.username:
            raise Exception("You cannot fight yourself")

        if self.health <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Your health is lower than or equal to 0. You need to rest")

        if enemy_hero.health <= 0:
            raise ValueError(f"You cannot fight {enemy_hero.username}. He needs to rest")

        player_damage = self.damage * self.level
        enemy_hero_damage = enemy_hero.damage * enemy_hero.level

        self.health -= enemy_hero_damage
        enemy_hero.health -= player_damage

        if self.health <= 0 and enemy_hero.health <= 0:
            return "Draw"

        if enemy_hero.health <= 0:
            self.level += 1
            self.health += 5
            self.damage += 5
            return "You win"

        enemy_hero.level += 1
        enemy_hero.health += 5
        enemy_hero.damage += 5
        return "You lose"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Hero {self.username}: {self.level} lvl\n" \
               f"Health: {self.health}\n" \
               f"Damage: {self.damage}\n"

*) You have the structure and functionality of the classe, and now you should test it.
*) You are NOT ALLOWED to change the class.
*) Cover the whole class with unit tests to make sure that the class is working as intended.

Submit only the test folder.
