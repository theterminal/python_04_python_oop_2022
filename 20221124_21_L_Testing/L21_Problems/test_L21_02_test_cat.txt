------------------------------------


class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.fed = False
        self.sleepy = False
        self.size = 0

    def eat(self):
        if self.fed:
            raise Exception('Already fed.')
        self.fed = True
        self.sleepy = True
        self.size += 1

    def sleep(self):
        if not self.fed:
            raise Exception('Cannot sleep while hungry')
        self.sleepy = False


------------------------------------


Create a class CatTests
In judge you need to submit just the CatTests class, with the unitttest module imported.


Create the following tests:
--------------------------
    *) Cat's size is increased after eating
    *) Cat is fed after eating
    *) Cat cannot eat if already fed, raises an error
    *) Cat cannot fall asleep if not fed, raises an error
    *) Cat is not sleepy after sleeping


Hints:
-----
Follow the logic of the previous problem
