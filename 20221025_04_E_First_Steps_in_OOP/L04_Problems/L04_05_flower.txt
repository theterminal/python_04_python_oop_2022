Create a class called Flower.
Upon initialization, the class should receive a name (string) and a water_requirements (number).
The flower should also have an instance attribute called is_happy (False by default).

Add two additional methods to the class:
    *) water(quantity) - it will water the flower.
       Each time check if the quantity is greater than or equal to the required.
       If it is - the flower becomes happy (set is_happy to True).

    *) status() - it should return "{name} is happy" if the flower is happy, otherwise it should return "{name} is not happy".

Submit only the class in the judge system.
