07 - Programmer - judge: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Compete/Index/1935#6


Create a class called Programmer.
Upon initialization, it should receive name (string), language (string), skills (integer).

The class should have two methods:
    *) watch_course(course_name, language, skills_earned)
        - If the programmer's language is the same as the one on the course,
          increase his skills with the given amount and return a message "{name} watched {course_name}".

        - Otherwise return "{name} does not know {language}".

    *) change_language(new_language, skills_needed)
        - If the programmer has the skills and the new language is not the same as his,
          change his language to the new one and return "{name} switched from {previous_language} to {new_language}".

        - If the programmer has the skills, but the given language is equal to his return "{name} already knows {language}".

        - In the last case, the programmer does not have enough skills,
          so return "{name} needs {needed_skills} more skills" and do not change his language.

Submit only the class in the judge system.


_____________ Test Data ______________


Test Code 1:
-----------
programmer = Programmer("John", "Java", 50)
print(programmer.watch_course("Python Masterclass", "Python", 84))
print(programmer.change_language("Java", 30))
print(programmer.change_language("Python", 100))
print(programmer.watch_course("Java: zero to hero", "Java", 50))
print(programmer.change_language("Python", 100))
print(programmer.watch_course("Python Masterclass", "Python", 84))


Output 1:
--------
John does not know Python
John already knows Java
John needs 50 more skills
John watched Java: zero to hero
John switched from Java to Python
John watched Python Masterclass
