06 - Steam User - judge: https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Compete/Index/1935#5


Create a class called SteamUser.
Upon initialization, it should receive a username (string) and games (list).
It should also have an attribute called played_hours (0 by default).

Add three methods to the class:
    *) play(game, hours)
        - If the game is in the game list, increase the played_hours by the given hours and return "{username} is playing {game}"
        - Otherwise, return "{game} is not in library"

    *) buy_game(game)
        - If the game is not in the game list, add it and return "{username} bought {game}"
        - Otherwise, return "{game} is already in your library"

    *) status() - returns the following:
        - "{username} has {games_count} games. Total play time: {played_hours}"

Submit only the class in the judge system.
