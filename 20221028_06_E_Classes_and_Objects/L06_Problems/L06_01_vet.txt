Create a class called Vet.
Upon initialization, it should receive a name (string).
It should also have an instance attribute called animals (empty list by default).

There should also be 2 class attributes:
	-	animals (empty list) which will store the total amount of animals for all vets;
	-	and space (5 by default).

You should create 3 additional instance methods:
    *) register_animal(animal_name)
        - If there is space in the vet clinic, adds the animal to both animals' lists and returns a message: "{name} registered in the clinic"
        - Otherwise, returns "Not enough space"

    *) unregister_animal(animal_name)
        - If the animal is in the clinic, removes it from both animals' lists and returns "{animal} unregistered successfully"
        - Otherwise, returns "{animal} not in the clinic"

    *) info()
        - Returns info about the vet, the number of animals in his list and the free space in the clinic:
          "{vet_name} has {number_animals} animals. {space_left_in_clinic} space left in clinic"

Test Code 1:
-----------
peter = Vet("Peter")
george = Vet("George")
print(peter.register_animal("Tom"))
print(george.register_animal("Cory"))
print(peter.register_animal("Fishy"))
print(peter.register_animal("Bobby"))
print(george.register_animal("Kay"))
print(george.unregister_animal("Cory"))
print(peter.register_animal("Silky"))
print(peter.unregister_animal("Molly"))
print(peter.unregister_animal("Tom"))
print(peter.info())
print(george.info())


Output 1:
--------
Tom registered in the clinic
Cory registered in the clinic
Fishy registered in the clinic
Bobby registered in the clinic
Kay registered in the clinic
Cory unregistered successfully
Silky registered in the clinic
