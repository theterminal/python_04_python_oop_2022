Create a class called PizzaDelivery.
Upon initialization, it should receive a name (string), a price (float), and ingredients (dictionary).
The class should also have an instance attribute ordered set to False by default.

You should also create 3 additional instance methods:
    *) add_extra(ingredient: str, quantity: int, price_per_quantity: float):

        - If we already have this ingredient in our pizza,
          increase the ingredient quantity with the given one and update the pizza price by adding the ingredient price for the given quantity

        - If we do not have this ingredient in our pizza, we should add it and update the pizza price

    *) remove_ingredient(ingredient: str, quantity: int, price_per_quantity: float):

        - If we do not have this ingredient in our pizza,
          we should return the following message "Wrong ingredient selected! We do not use {ingredient} in {pizza_name}!"

        - If we have the ingredient, but we try to remove more than we have available,
          we should return the following message "Please check again the desired quantity of {ingredient}!"

        - Otherwise, remove the given quantity of the ingredient and update the pizza price by removing the ingredient price for the given quantity

    *) make_order()
        - Set the attribute ordered to True and return the following message
          "You've ordered pizza {pizza_name} prepared with {ingredient: quantity} and the price will be {price}lv.".
          The ingredients should be separated by a comma and a space ", "

        - Keep in mind that once the pizza is ordered, no further changes are allowed.
          We should return the following message if the customer tries to change it:
          "Pizza {name} already prepared, and we can't make any changes!"


__________ Test Data __________


Test Code 1:
-----------
margarita = PizzaDelivery('Margarita', 11, {'cheese': 2, 'tomatoes': 1})
margarita.add_extra('mozzarella', 1, 0.5)
margarita.add_extra('cheese', 1, 1)
margarita.remove_ingredient('cheese', 1, 1)
print(margarita.remove_ingredient('bacon', 1, 2.5))
print(margarita.remove_ingredient('tomatoes', 2, 0.5))
margarita.remove_ingredient('cheese', 2, 1)
print(margarita.make_order())
print(margarita.add_extra('cheese', 1, 1))


Output 1:
--------
Wrong ingredient selected! We do not use bacon in Margarita!
Please check again the desired quantity of tomatoes!
You've ordered pizza Margarita prepared with cheese: 0, tomatoes: 1, mozzarella: 1 and the price will be 9.5lv.
Pizza Margarita already prepared, and we can't make any changes!
